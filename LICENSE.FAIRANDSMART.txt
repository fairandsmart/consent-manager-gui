ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO RIGHT REQUEST AND ITS SOURCE CODE (“The 
Program”).

The following additional terms ("Additional Terms") supplement and modify the 
GNU General Public License, Version 3 ("GPLv3 License") applicable to the 
Program. In addition to the terms and conditions of the GPLv3, the Program is 
subject to the additional terms below:


1. Grant of Additional Permission.

FAIR AND SMART grants its customers the following additional permission under 
Section 7 of the GPLv3 License. FAIR AND SMART grants its customers the 
additional permission to modify, combine or link the Program with any other 
program, software, plugin or work conveyed under any other license, including a 
proprietary license, provided that the resulting work (“Combined Work”) is 
used by the customer solely for internal purposes, excluding any distribution, 
propagation or use of the Program or the Combined Work for any commercial 
purposes, even free of charge. This additional permission shall not be 
construed, by any means, as a permission to distribute, propagate and/or convey 
the Program or any program or work resulting, combined, linked or otherwise 
used with the Program under any other license, including a proprietary license, 
for any other purposes than those listed above, in particular for commercial 
purposes.

2. Replacement of Section 15.

Section 15 of the GPLv3 License shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced 
with the following:

You accept that the Program was not created with a view to satisfy Your 
individual requirements. Therefore, you must ensure that the Program comply 
with Your needs, requirements and constraints. FAIR AND SMART represents and 
warrants that it holds, without any restriction or reservation, all the legal 
titles, authorizations and intellectual property rights granted in the context 
of the GPLv3 License. FAIR AND SMART will defend at its own expense any action 
brought against You to the extent that said action is based on a claim, suit, 
proceeding that you infringed such party’s copyright in the context of this 
license (“the Claim”) and will pay those costs and damages finally awarded 
against You, provided that:
(i) The Claim exclusively concerns the version of the Program created and 
propagated by FAIR & SMART (<https://www.fairandsmart.com);
(ii) The Claim is not the result of your failure to comply with the GPLv3 
License;
(iii) You do not assume any responsibility, or enter into any agreement or 
compromise concerning the Claim without FAIR AND SMART's prior written 
authorization;
(iv) You allow FAIR AND SMART and its advisers (upon reasonable notice) to 
access Your premises and to interview Your agents, directors, employees, 
representatives or advisers, and to consult any related documents and allow 
them to make copies thereof in order to assess the Claim;
(v) You take all reasonable measures requested by FAIR AND SMART in order to 
avoid, contest, compromise or defend the Claim;
(vi) You notify the Claim to FAIR AND SMART by registered mail within thirty 
(30) days upon receipt.
Under no circumstances whatsoever shall this provision apply to:
(i) any modified version of the Program whether such modification was made by 
You or a third party;
(ii) any claim, suit or proceeding related to any software, program, extension, 
plugin or any other work linked, combined or used with the Program.


3. Replacement of Section 16.

Section 16 of the GPLv3 License shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced 
with the following:

You may hold FAIR AND SMART liable provided that you have previously notified 
the alleged breach to FAIR AND SMART by registered mail and that FAIR AND SMART 
has not replied to this formal notice within thirty (30) days upon receipt. 
FAIR AND SMART may only be held liable if you demonstrate FAIR AND SMART is at 
fault.
FAIR AND SMART shall be liable for the consequences resulting solely from its 
own faults, errors or omissions, except in the case of force majeure as defined 
by French case law. In addition, FAIR AND SMART shall only be liable for direct 
and foreseeable damages resulting from the use of the Program. Accordingly, 
FAIR AND SMART shall not be liable under any circumstances for any indirect or 
unforeseeable loss or damage, including but not limited to any lost profits, 
loss, inaccuracy or corruption of files or data, commercial prejudice, loss of 
turnover or profit, loss of customers, loss of opportunity, cost of obtaining a 
substitute product, service or technology, in connection with or arising from 
the use of the Program.
In particular, FAIR AND SMART shall not be liable for any direct or indirect 
damages arising from, out of or in connection with:
· Any use of the program in relation with any other program, software, 
extension, database or any other work;
· Any abnormal or illicit use of the Program;
· Computer viruses;
· Your failure to comply with this license;
· Any problem or failure to use the Program due to your hardware or computer 
equipment or Internet connection;
· The destruction or alteration of data collected by or with the Program.
Under no circumstances whatsoever shall FAIR AND SMART be held liable for any 
damage whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise for any damage or 
other liability, including any general, direct, indirect, special, incidental, 
consequential or punitive damages arising from, out of or in connection with 
any modification made to the Program by you or a third party whether or not 
FAIR AND SMART receives notice of any such damages and whether or not such 
damages could have been foreseen.


4. Further Restriction.

The Program shall not be used, conveyed or propagated by any company having 
their head office in Luxembourg or Belgium without FAIR&SMART’s prior written 
consent.


5. Dual Licensing

FAIR AND SMART reserves the right to diverge and/or modify and/or expand the 
Program and/or to use, propagate or distribute a closed source/proprietary 
version of the Program or its extensions in whole or in part alongside with the 
open source version of said Program in the future.


6. Translation

In the event of a conflict between the English and French versions of the license,
the English version shall prevail.
